## Project Setup
#### Pre-Requisites
Ensure that you have Node.js installed on your system. You can check if node is already installed by using
`node -v` in your OS terminal.  
If you do not have Node.js installed, you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
  
#### Installing Packages
Before we can run the service, you will have to install all packages used in our project first.    
1. Clone this repository if you haven't already done so.
2. Open up the terminal and change the directory to the AugmentedSpace folder within the repo.
3. Run `npm install` or `npm i` on your terminal. This will install all project dependencies in our application.
     
#### Running The Program
Use `npx expo start --tunnel` to run the service. You might be asked to install expo/ngrok, say yes so we can create a tunnel and access the application on our phones. This will create a QR code for you to scan on your mobile device. Install **Expo Go** on your phone and scan the QR code to view the project on your device. Any changes to the code can be seen in realtime.

#### Running The Unity Program
For android users, downloading the apk file in the ("Unity-Project" -> "AS-TestDeploys" ->) "Test1" folder on your device. To ensure it installs properly, open the Unity Project and Run+Build it from there.
####     Android Reqs
        Be sure your phone is set to Developer Mode. (Use this video as a guide https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCXwaehzRFQ)
